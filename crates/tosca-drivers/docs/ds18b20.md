# DS18B20 - Temperature Sensor

The **DS18B20** is a digital temperature sensor
supported by the `tosca-drivers` crate via the `ds18b20` feature.

## Wiring

The following diagram shows how to connect a DS18B20 sensor to an ESP32-C3 board.

| DS18B20 Pin  | ESP32-C3 Pin |
|--------------|--------------|
| VCC          | 3.3/5V       |
| GND          | GND          |
| DATA         | Any GPIO     |

A 4.7kΩ pull-up resistor is typically required between **DATA** and **VCC**.

## Usage

Enable the DS18B20 driver in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tosca-drivers = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["ds18b20"] }
