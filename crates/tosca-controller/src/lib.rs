//! A crate library to manage, orchestrate, and interact with all
//! `tosca`-compliant devices present in a network.
//!
//! Among its tasks:
//!
//! - Discovering all `tosca-compliant` devices contained in a network
//! - Building `REST` requests to send commands to the discovered devices
//! - Defining scheduling programs to control requests sending
//! - Setting security and privacy policies to allow or prevent a request
//!   from being sent
//!
//! The possibility of defining scheduling programs allows to implement
//! batch processing, hence all those requests which have determined properties
//! can be grouped together and sent to different devices either immediately or
//! at a later time.
//!
//! Some APIs invoke threads to perform their operations. This choice has been
//! taken to split up huge tasks into small independent ones and distribute the
//! system resource load.
