//! The communication interface among a device and a controller.
//!
//! This crate contains a series of APIs to:
//!
//! - Encode and decode the file containing the description of a device and
//!   all of its routes. A route is expressed as an address which a controller
//!   can invoke to execute an action on a device.
//! - Manage the hazards which might occur on a device when a determined route
//!   is being invoked. Hazards can also be employed to manage the events
//!   happening on a device.
//! - Manage the input parameters of a route. An input parameter represents
//!   an argument for a device action. For example, a boolean which
//!   controls the state of a light, or a range of floats to control the
//!   brightness of a light.
//!
//! It also provides some structures to share data among a device and
//! a controller. Each of these structures must be both serializable and
//! deserializable. A device fills in these structures, while a controller
//! consumes them.
//!
//! This crate can be used both on `std` and `no_std` environments. Indeed, the
//! `std` features is enabled by default.
