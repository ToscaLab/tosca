# `ascot-library`

[![LICENSE][license badge]][license]

This Rust library contains a series of APIs and interfaces to:

- Create and manage HTTP `Rest` routes
- Define a device and its methods
- Associate some hazards to a device

It can even run on an embedded system since it is a `no_std` library.

The [ascot-axum](./ascot-axum) and [ascot-esp32c3](./ascot-esp32c3) are two Rust
libraries which make use of the `ascot-library` as dependency to define the
APIs for their respective architectures.

The `ascot-axum` library is thought for firmware which run on operating systems.
In the [ascot-axum/examples](./ascot-axum/examples) directory, two different
device firmware have been implemented as examples: a
[light](./ascot-axum/examples/light) and a [fridge](./ascot-axum/examples/fridge).

The `ascot-esp32c3` library is thought for firmware which run on a `ESP32-C3`
board.
In the [ascot-esp32c3/devices](./ascot-esp32c3/devices) directory, a simple
device firmware has been implemented as example: a [light](./ascot-esp32c3/devices/light).
