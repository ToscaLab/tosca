# Ascot Firmware

The `Ascot Firmware` is a REST server developed with the `Ascot` interface,
which provides a series of abstractions to interact with the commands defined
on a smart home device.
Through `REST` APIs, the server can run tasks on a device, retrieve some
of its data, or change some of its properties. 

The device is discoverable within the network through a `mDNS-SD` service.

In `ascot-axum/examples` there are some implementation examples.
